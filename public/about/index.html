    <h3>What is DJ Phonetic?</h3>

    <p>DJ Phonetic is a free online tool for making beats with the kicks, snares, and hi-hats that are hidden within human speech.</p>

    <h3>Who made DJ Phonetic?</h3>

    <p>This project was created by <a href="https://brianfoo.com/">Brian Foo</a>, an artist who likes to make creative tools powered by open culture from libraries, archives, and museums. He was the 2020 <a href="https://labs.loc.gov/about/opportunities/innovator-in-residence-program" target="_blank">Innovator in Residence</a> at the Library of Congress where he created <a href="https://citizen-dj.labs.loc.gov/" target="_blank">Citizen DJ</a>, a tool for creating hip hop music using the Library's free-to-use audio and visual material.</p>

    <h3>Why did you create this project?</h3>
    
    <p>Oral histories, speeches, interviews, and readings are largely untapped resources for music making. Though not as easy as drawing inspiration from existing music, if you look hard enough, there are beats, rhythms, and melodies embedded in speech.</p>

    <h3>Where do you get your source material from?</h3>

    <h3>How do you choose what parts of speech correspond to different drums?</h3>

    <h3>Are the drum sounds really just from speech?</h3>

    <h3>Can I download what I create?</h3>

    <h3>Can I download the audio as a drum kit?</h3>

    <h3>Is this project open source?</h3>
