But if you write good science fiction, you see, you are dealing a different—a different society, a different background. And you have two things to do. [Uh] On one hand you have to explain the background. You have to talk about the kind of society that exists. And you mustn't skimp that because the society is sometimes the most interesting part of the story. On the other hand, you also have something going on in the foreground, events taking place against that background and you don't want to skimp that either. So you have the difficult task—the very difficult task of [uh] letting the events taking place without obscuring the background and describing the background without delaying the events in the foreground. This is extremely difficult to do. With the result, that writing good science fiction—and I emphasize good because, you know, bad science fiction like bad anything is very easy to write. [Uh] But writing good science fiction is the hardest thing in the world, really.
