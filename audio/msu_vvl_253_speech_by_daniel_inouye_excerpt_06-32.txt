But then if Mesopotamia, the ancient cradle of civilization, must once again become a cauldron of conflict, then let it be for the principles which the countries of the United Nations reaffirm in twelve Security Council resolutions.

But let it be forever remembered that many of those who did participate in that war may just remember pain, brutality, and ugliness.
