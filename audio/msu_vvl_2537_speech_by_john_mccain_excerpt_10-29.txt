What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions. We're not getting done much apart. I don't think thatâ€”think any of us feels proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater satisfaction in respecting our differences but not letting them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of core principles, agreements made good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people. The Senate is capable of that. We know that. We've seen it before. I've seen it happen many times. And the times when I was involved, even in a modest way with working on a bipartisan response to a national problem or threat, are the proudest moments of my career and by far, the most satisfying.
