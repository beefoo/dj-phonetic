You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my s—son.  Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me uh thirty five years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, um there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that um the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that— that doesn't go away.
