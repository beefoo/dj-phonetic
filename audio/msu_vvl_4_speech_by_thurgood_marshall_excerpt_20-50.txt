On the other hand, the cause of persons accused of crime, however much protection it may receive in legal theory, is inherently one that is unattractive to the popular mind, and the rights they receive are in constant danger of erosion. This is particularly true in the United States, where regrettably a pattern of public tolerance of brutal police practices, mob violence, grossly unfair trial procedures has existed in many areas, and as a sort of dark underside to the noble pronouncements of the Bill of Rights. And yet I think there are few who would deny that an impeccably fair process of criminal justice is one of the values that lies closest to the core of any free society, simply because the power asserted by government against a charged criminal is so great as to dwarf any others it exercises.
