In middle school I had a teacher who told me over and over again, read, my child, read, my child. And I tried to read everything that I had. We didn't have that many books in our home when I was growing up, but I read the books, the newspapers, the magazines. And I would tell young people to read, read. Uh You know, you may not have the resources to travel, but by reading, by going to the library, you can travel all over American. You can travel all over the world. And people must have um the desire to get out there, to push and pull and to never give up, to never get lost in a sea of despair, but to keep the faith.
