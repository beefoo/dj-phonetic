I don't really believe that we're going to be able to create the kind of attitudinal changes that need to be created in this country for another generation or two. And so—because I don't—I can't leave that kind of issue to the morality—to the morality of people in power in our country. I have very deep feelings about that. Secondly, I think that if Americans, whether they're white, black, pink, green, if just plain Americans would commit themselves and the basis of their deeds and their actions to really moving in terms of eliminating these obstacles that prevent us communicating with each other and moving, they say, a nation of people, we won't have to talk about these things, but we're going to have to continue to create legislation—and what have you—that at least will protect those who need the most protection. As hopefully some day in the future we won't have to talk about these things.
